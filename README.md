- 👀 I’m interested in programming. wait, before you write me off just hear me out. i love programming, every aspect of it, from web development to app development im 100% invested in it.
  but most recently im particularly intrigued by data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python django, UI/UX and SQL

- ⚡ Fun fact: ive created a Virtual assistant that automatically configures the django backend process of initialization in less than 30 seconds. allowing me to focus solely on
 front end development and very little on backend process. Upon doing this im looking to integrate my virtual assistant into the django web app so that i have my very own AI to help me with web
 front end even more efficiently.
